Users can view videos by genre and scroll horizontally to check them all out. Upon hovering over a single movie tile, users can see more details, including the movie title and its description. Users can then play each movie directly from each tile by pushing the play button, which brings them to a full screen video player page of the selected movie.

## Live Video Search

(In progress). My Lists is a bonus functionality that Petflix has, but Netflix does not. While Netflix has one universal "My List", Petflix allows a user to create multiple lists to organize videos in different sets for later consumption. It is currently in progress.
